title: About me
---
If there's one thing that describes me, it's that I'm a jack-of-all-trades. Through my background as sysadmin, I've acquired strong scripting and problem-solving skills, which I use every day. CICD pipelines, networking, troubleshooting, containerization, those are my bread and butter.


I'm extremely curious and perpetually working on improving my skills. As such, I've dabbled into a wide range of technologies across both the front-end and the back-end, and even software development.
