As a sysadmin at Telus Health, I play a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of the Personal Health Records system used by [Alberta](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/myhealthrecords) and [Saskatchewan](https://www.ehealthsask.ca/MySaskHealthRecord/MySaskHealthRecord/Pages/About.aspx). This system serves over a million users.

My day-to-day responsibilities include OS patching, software deployment and level 3 support. I'm also very involved in monitoring the platform, ensuring that any issues or problems are quickly identified and resolved, keeping the system running smoothly for its users.

In addition to my administrative tasks, I also have a solid background in development, with experience in both Javascript and C#. This makes me a valuable asset to the team, as I can not only manage the infrastructure but also contribute to the development of new features and enhancements.
