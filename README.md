# Netlify_Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for a static website hosted on netlify, which is my personal [portfolio](https://philippedesmarais.netlify.app/).

The website has not been tested with Internet Explorer, so I wouldn't be surprised if it had layout issues with that system. I tested it /w the mobile devices I could get my hands on, but those were all iOS so I couldn't really see how well it deals with android phones
